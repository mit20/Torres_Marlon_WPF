// Marlon Torres - December 4, 2013 - Web Programming Fundamentals - Dog Years Problem

//Calculate how old Sparky the pit bull is in dog years based on his actual age. Dogs age 7 times faster than humans
// so a dog that is 1 year old in human years is 7 years old in “dog years.”  Calculate how old Sparky the pit bull
// is in dog years based on his actual age.

var humanYear = 1; //Given 1 equals a human year.
